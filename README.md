# Damage-Detection-in-civil-infrastructures-using-multispectral-images.
Damage detection plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet computer vision-based methods face limitations from inconsistent lighting, environmental noise, and complex backgrounds, which can hinder accurate damage detection. To address this challenge, this work introduces an enhanced damage detection algorithm CSP-CAS which incorporates Compact Inverted Block (CIB) to optimize Cross Stage Partial (CSP) net and integrates it with Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS) in the neck and head of You Only Look Once (YOLO) v9 Architecture.
