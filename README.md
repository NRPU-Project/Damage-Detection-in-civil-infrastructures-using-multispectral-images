# Damage-Detection-in-civil-infrastructures-using-multispectral-images.
Damage detection plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet computer vision-based methods face limitations from inconsistent lighting, environmental noise, and complex backgrounds, which can hinder accurate damage detection. To address this challenge, this work introduces an enhanced damage detection algorithm CSP-CAS which incorporates Compact Inverted Block (CIB) to optimize Cross Stage Partial (CSP) net and integrates it with Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS) in the neck and head of You Only Look Once (YOLO) v9 Architecture.

### üîß Setup Instructions (Google Colab + Google Drive)

**Step 1: Prepare Google Drive Folder**  
- Open your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).  
- Create a new folder and name it (e.g., `CSP-CAS`).

**Step 2: Upload Model Files**  
- Download and upload CSP-CAS model files.

**Step 3: Upload YAML Configuration File**  
- Upload a dataset YAML file with correct training/validation/test paths and class names.

**Step 4: Upload Dataset**  
- Upload your dataset (e.g., `data.zip`) containing images and annotations.

**Step 5: Create Output Folder**  
- Inside your main folder, create a subfolder named `run` to store training results, weights, and logs.
Sure! Here's a concise summary you can add to your GitHub repository:

### üîç Inference with Trained Model

If you already have a trained model (weights saved in the `runs` folder), you can directly use it to test crack detection performance on new or test images. Simply load the weights and run the detection script on your desired test set to visualize and verify how effectively the model identifies cracks. This allows for quick validation without retraining the model.
